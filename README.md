Description:
This Java program implements a basic banking system with functionalities for account management, fund transactions, and transaction history tracking.

The program consists of two main classes: Account and Bank. The Account class represents individual bank accounts and contains attributes such as the account number, balance, and transaction history. It provides methods for depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and retrieving the transaction history.

The Bank class serves as the central component of the system, responsible for managing multiple accounts and facilitating banking operations. It maintains a list of accounts using an ArrayList and provides methods for creating accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, transferring funds between accounts, viewing transaction history, and checking account balances.

Input is obtained from the user via the command line using the Scanner class. Users are presented with a menu-driven interface where they can choose from various banking operations. Each operation prompts the user for necessary inputs and performs the corresponding action based on the user's selection.

The program ensures data encapsulation and abstraction by encapsulating account-related data within the Account class and providing public methods for interacting with account objects. Error handling is implemented to handle scenarios such as invalid account numbers or insufficient funds during withdrawals.

Overall, this program demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It provides a simplified yet functional implementation of a banking system, suitable for educational purposes or as a basis for further expansion into more complex banking applications.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Java program presented here offers a solid foundation for a basic banking system. It leverages object-oriented principles to organize the code into manageable classes and methods, enhancing readability, maintainability, and scalability.

The Account class encapsulates the essential attributes and behaviors of a bank account, such as the account number, balance, and transaction history. Through methods like depositing, withdrawing, and retrieving transaction history, it provides the necessary functionalities to manage individual accounts efficiently.

The Bank class acts as the orchestrator of banking operations, handling account creation, fund transactions, and information retrieval. By maintaining a list of accounts and offering methods for various banking tasks, it enables users to interact with the system seamlessly.

The program adopts a user-friendly approach by employing a menu-driven interface, allowing users to navigate through different banking operations easily. Input validation and error handling mechanisms are incorporated to ensure the robustness and reliability of the system, providing informative feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or insufficient funds.

Overall, this program serves as a practical demonstration of core Java concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and control structures. While it offers a simplified version of a banking system, it lays the groundwork for more sophisticated implementations, offering ample opportunities for further refinement and expansion. Through additional features such as user authentication, transaction logging, and graphical user interfaces, this program can evolve into a comprehensive banking application suitable for real-world use.
